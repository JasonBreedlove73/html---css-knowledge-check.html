The assignment was to create a code that correctly displays forms, tables, navigation bars, and images.
I created my page using an HTML5 structure using the <!doctype html> command.
I ensured that the page was going to be responsive by using the viewport meta tag.
I then created a navigation bar using the <nav> command and using the <ul> <ui><a href> to create my links
At this point i created a simple contact form customers could use to reach out to the company.
After reviewing my notes i wanted to try the bonus and add the radio buttons.
For the table structure and products I picked the products I use on my own vehicles.
Placeholder images, i had no trouble formating the first image using the <img src> command although the bonus image gave me a run for my money.
I had trouble with the styling command but after trial and error i finally figured it out.
